# Decision 0001 — Project Scope

Status: Accepted

Context:
We need to define whether MONES is a commercial product or a research-driven open-source project.

Decision:
MONES will be open-source and learning-focused.

Rationale:
- Primary goal is education and experimentation.
- Encourages collaboration and transparency.
- Reduces pressure of monetization.
- Enables community contributions.

Consequences:
- No commercial pressure.
- Slower development pace is acceptable.
- Documentation quality becomes critical.
