# Vision

MONES aims to redefine how operating systems are used on a single machine.

Instead of dual-booting or running virtual machines as secondary tools,
MONES treats full operating systems as first-class environments.

Core Ideas:

- Each OS is isolated by default.
- Switching between OS environments should feel natural.
- The host layer should remain minimal and secure.
- The system should run efficiently on consumer hardware.

Long-Term Vision:

A system where users can:

- Run development OS
- Run experimental OS
- Run secure browsing OS
- Run custom-built OS

All on the same machine, without compromise.
